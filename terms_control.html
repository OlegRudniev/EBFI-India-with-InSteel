        <p class="main-p">Often, when ordering equipment or services, companies are faced with the fact that the manufacturer can not complete the work in time. Despite a scrupulous assessment of supplier capabilities, supplier audits, resources, management processes implemented, etc., there will always be risks of delayed supply by the supplier of inventory. In this case, the customer, based on an assessment of the consequences of disruptions in the delivery time of equipment, conducts expediting. Expediting has the goal of obtaining objective information not only about the status of order fulfillment and existing threats to fulfill the order on time, but also "pushing" the manufacturer to fulfill its obligations.</p>
        <p class="main-p">Expediting is a periodic audit of the progress of the order stages, such as the development of design documentation, the purchase of materials, the order of materials and components, production, testing, elimination of identified inconsistencies, ordering transport, shipment, and delivery of products. The timing of the stages is determined by the project schedule, in which the deadlines for each stage are determined and these dates are determined by the customer and agreed with the manufacturer. At each stage of execution, something may go wrong, for example, elimination of errors in design documentation may take more time, rejection of forgings during incoming inspection, will require the supply of new forgings, delay in approval of the design, may lead to a delay in the delivery of goods and materials ... After carrying out expediting, the customer will be able to obtain reliable information about the status of projects and push the manufacturer to fulfill the supply contract.</p>
        <p class="main-p">Expediting periodically visits of the enterprise and evaluates the progress of the project, evaluates the implementation of the stages of the production schedule. If a delay is identified, the auditor needs to determine the reasons. Corrective actions are developed and discussed with the manufacturer to eliminate the delay in the stage. At the same time, threats are identified that require the customer's attention. Based on the results, a expediting report is issued, which provides a general description of the order fulfillment, statuses for the respective stages (design, procurement, receipt of materials, ITP production, acceptance tests, painting, marking and shipment) and delays in the implementation of stages and threats to project.</p>
